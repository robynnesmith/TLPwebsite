            <p class="hobbiestext" id="pltext">In the Summer of 2015, someone suggested to me that I should give the sport of Powerlifting a try.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Since then, I have been training hard in the gym and have competed four times over the course of two years.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Part of my decision to move back to the U.K. was influenced by my desire to attempt to get onto the British team. My long term goal is to qualify for World Champioships and represent Great Britain.

            <p class="hobbiestext">From a young age, I spent as much time as possible in the water, either the swimming pool or the sea. Both my parents learnt to scuba dive, and both my brother and I got qualified as soon as we were old enough.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Diving has taken us to some incredible places over the years, and allowed us to discover a whole new world beneath the waves. For more pictures from my diving adventures, click

            <img id="skiphoto" src="images/ski-young.jpg" alt="Sorry, this image in unavailable">
            <p class="hobbiestext">Similar to diving, I have been skiing for most of my life. I absolutely love the rush of zooming down a mountain on a beautiful bluebird day.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            During my gap year, I took the opportunity to improve my skiing ability (as I wasn't very good up until then!) and travelled to Whistler, Canada, to learn to become a ski instructor. This was a fantastic experience and I would highly recommend it to everyone! To see some more pictures from my ski holidays, click

            Home cooked food has always been important in our family, and this love of cooking and food has been passed down to me.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            With a Chef for a Grandad, I think a love of food and cooking was fairly inevitable. 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            My favourite course is desserts. Whenever I have the opportunity, I revel in making desserts for other people and (hopefully!) seeing the enjoyment in their faces when they eat it!
